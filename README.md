This is the core python library for the IceNet project.

### Installation

Currently you'll need to clone this repository to use the library. We're still working on dependency management via pip. If you're having trouble with system dependencies some advice about environment setup is given by the examples [under the pipeline repository][1].

cd icenet
pip install .
